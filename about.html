                <h1>ABOUT</h1>
                <p>My name is Laavanya Agarwal and I am a 10th Grade student at Oberoi International School (OIS). <br> Recently, to follow my interest in programming, I decided to take courses to learn the <br> coding languages HTML and CSS, and I share my learnings with you through this website.

                <br> <br> I have always been interested in programming and so also have some prior experience with it. While I did get a small chance to <br> explore HTML and CSS in school, it was very brief- just enough to spark my interest <br> but not enough to teach me enough on how to use them to my best capabilities. Due to this <br> I decided to use Udemy and Coursera courses to learn the languages and share my learnings with you! </p>
