            <h1>Introduction to CSS</h1>
                <p>CSS is the language we use to style a Web page, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.
                    <br> .
                    <br>
                    This language allows you to customise each element, class/id (group), etc. separately based on your wants and likes
                    <br>
                </p>
            <h1>CSS Syntax</h1>
                <h5> Selector + {property:value; property: value; ....} <br> . <br> </h5>
                <h6> For elements...</h6>
                    <p>In order to customise a particular element, you simply write down the element (such as h1), <br>
                    open the curly brackets, select the property- the options come as a dropdown in most editors (eg color, font-size, font-family, margin, padding, etc.)<br>
                    After each property, add a colon (:), the value (eg a specific color if the property is font-color), and end it with a semi-colon (;) to begin a new property.
                    To end the element's styling, add a closing curly bracket, and begin writing for the next element from the next line onwards. </p> 

                    <h6> For classes...</h6>
                    <p>In order to customise a particular class, you simply write down the class along with period (.) - eg .nav, <br>
                    and style your code as you would for elements </p> 

                    <h6> For IDs...</h6>
                    <p>In order to customise a particular ID, you simply write down the class along with hashtag (#) - eg #button, <br>
                    and style your code as you would for elements </p> 

                    <h6> To specifiy further... </h6>
                    <p> After the element/class/ID written, add a space and add the element/class/ID within the previous category. <br>
                    This allows you to customise the specific codes within a certain category in a category. <br>
                    For instance, you can customise the heading tag in the navigation bar class (.nav h1) differently from the one in the text box class (.textbox h1).</p>
            <h1>A few common properties include...</h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> Color (font-color, background-color)
                        <br>"h" indicates a heading, and the number after indicates the size (ranging from 1-6, 1 being the largest)</li> <br>
                    <li> Font (font-color, font-family, font-size)
                        <br> "p" indicates a paragraph, which is generally styled to be smaller than the heading tag (though you can customise it)</li> <br>
                    <li> Spacing and Sizing (padding, margin, margin-left, text-align, position, length, width)
                        <br> "img" indicates an image- in this tag, rather than writing after closing the tag, it is written within the tag. <br>
                        Here, you can add details such as the source (src), size (width, height), alternate text (alt- for when image can't be displayed), etc. <br>
                    </li>
                </ul>
